## MEMORY → ACTION LINK

**Memory Finding:** RED_TEAM found 5 defects in live deployment: (1) Demo mode active, (2) CurseForge returns zero results, (3) Wrong result types (texture packs/mods instead of maps), (4) Only 2 of 5 sources working, (5) Poor search accuracy.

**Current Status:** RED_TEAM completed successfully and wrote DEFECTS_FOUND. Ralph-chain determined next phase is BUILDER to fix these defects.

**Direct Application:** The 5 defects need to be addressed by BUILDER. Key issues: CurseForge API configuration, result type filtering (maps only, not mods/texture packs), and search accuracy improvements.

**Action Taken:** Spawning BUILDER Round 61 to fix RED_TEAM defects. Builder will need to address API configuration, add type filtering, and improve source health.
