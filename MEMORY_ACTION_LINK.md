## MEMORY → ACTION LINK

**Memory Finding:** BUILDER Round 58 found 3 defects: (1) CurseForge unavailable (requires API key), (2) Query coverage inconsistent (some queries < 5 maps), (3) Planet Minecraft blocked by Cloudflare

**Current Status:** DEFECTS_FOUND - Chain determined next phase is BUILDER to continue fixing defects

**Direct Application:** System is functional with real Modrinth data but needs additional sources to meet 5+ maps requirement consistently. CurseForge requires manual API key configuration (not automatable). Planet Minecraft blocked by Cloudflare even with Puppeteer.

**Action Taken:** Spawning BUILDER Round 59 to explore alternative solutions: (1) Check if other Minecraft map sources exist (MCMaps, 9Minecraft, etc.), (2) Improve Modrinth query matching to increase results, (3) Document CurseForge API key requirement for user action.
