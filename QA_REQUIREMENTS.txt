# Multi-Source Scraper QA Requirements

## Test Coverage Required

### 1. Source Testing (All Sources Must Work)
- **Planet Minecraft**: Must return 5+ results for common queries
- **MinecraftMaps.com**: Must return results, handle Cloudflare
- **9Minecraft**: Must return results, extract download links
- **CurseForge**: Continue working as before

### 2. Unified Search Testing
- Query: "castle" → Should return results from multiple sources
- Query: "modern city" → Should return results from multiple sources  
- Query: "parkour" → Should return results from multiple sources
- Each result must have `source` field attribution

### 3. Rate Limiting Verification
- Maximum 1 request per second per source
- No source should be overwhelmed
- Parallel fetching should respect limits

### 4. Deduplication Testing
- Same map on multiple sources should appear once
- Should merge metadata from all sources

### 5. Circuit Breaker Testing
- Failed sources should not break entire search
- Should gracefully degrade
- Health endpoint should report source status

### 6. Performance Testing
- Response time < 10 seconds for all sources
- Timeout handling for slow sources

### 7. Download Link Verification
- At least 80% of results must have working download URLs
- Test actual downloads from each source

## Success Criteria
- All 4 sources return results
- Unified search combines results seamlessly
- Response time < 10 seconds
- 80%+ valid download links
- Deduplication working
- Circuit breakers functional
- Health check reports all sources
