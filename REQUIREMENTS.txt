# Minecraft Map Scraper - QA Requirements

## Absolute Standards (No Compromise)

### API Configuration
- CURSEFORGE_API_KEY environment variable MUST be configured on Railway deployment
- Demo/mock mode is FAILURE - app must use live CurseForge API
- Health check must return apiConfigured: true

### Search Functionality
- Natural language queries (e.g., "futuristic city with railways") must return 5+ REAL maps from CurseForge
- Results must have actual CurseForge IDs (not mock IDs like 1001, 1002)
- Each result must have working thumbnail images (not placeholders)

### Search Accuracy (High Standard)
- Search must return results that semantically match the user's query intent
- Minimum 1000 diverse keywords tested and validated for accuracy
- "Underwater city" must return maps that are actually underwater-themed
- "Hell" must return nether/demon/inferno themed maps, not random results
- Accuracy measured by: Result titles/descriptions must contain query keywords OR semantic equivalents
- False positive rate < 5% across 1000 test queries

### Download Functionality
- Download buttons must return valid ZIP files
- ZIP files must contain actual Minecraft map data (level.dat, region files)
- HTTP 200 responses, not 403 errors or JSON error messages

### Verification Method
1. Query: "futuristic city with railways" → Check IDs are real (not 1000+)
2. Query: "medieval castle" → Verify thumbnails load
3. Click download → Verify ZIP downloads successfully
4. Check file size > 1KB and contains level.dat

## Success Criteria
- All search queries return live API data (not mock)
- All downloads return valid ZIP files
- Response time < 10 seconds
- Demo mode indicator = false
