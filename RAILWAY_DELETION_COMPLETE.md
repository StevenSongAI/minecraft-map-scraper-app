**Date:** 2026-02-04  
**Time:** 00:10 EST

## What Was Deleted

**Account:** stevenyjsongai@gmail.com  
**Owner:** Nox (AI)  
**Status:** Trial  
**Projects:** zesty-charm (a18c5404-6b6a-4d09-936f-e90d391a5a2d)  
**Live URL (now dead):** https://web-production-631b7.up.railway.app

## Reason for Deletion

This account was causing confusion between:
- AI's Railway account (trial, limited)
- Steven's Railway account (paid, production)

The AI was logged into the wrong account and directing subagents to work on the AI's account instead of Steven's.

## Next Steps

1. ✅ AI's Railway account deleted
2. ⏭ Deploy minecraft-map-scraper to Steven's Railway account
3. ⏭ Set CURSEFORGE_API_KEY on Steven's Railway
4. ⏭ Verify deployment works
