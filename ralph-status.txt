DEFECT #1: CRITICAL - Planet Minecraft Scraper Completely Broken
----------------------------------------------------------------
Requirement: "MUST aggregate results from multiple sources beyond CurseForge" / "Primary additional sources: Planet Minecraft"
Evidence: Health check shows planetminecraft scraper returns HTTP 403 Forbidden with "Cloudflare bot protection active"
Impact: ZERO results from Planet Minecraft in ANY search query. Multi-source requirement NOT met.
Verification: curl /api/scrapers/status shows "accessible: false", "statusCode: 403"

DEFECT #2: CRITICAL - 9Minecraft Downloads Return HTML Not ZIP Files
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirement: "Download buttons must return valid ZIP files" / "ZIP files must contain actual Minecraft map data"
Evidence: 9Minecraft download URLs return HTML document text (verified via `file -` command)
Impact: Users cannot download actual Minecraft maps from 9Minecraft results
Verification: curl /api/download?id=9mc-... returns HTML content, not application/zip

DEFECT #3: HIGH - ALL 9Minecraft Results Require External Page Visit
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirement: "Download buttons must return valid ZIP files" / "Scraped results must have working download links"
Evidence: Every 9Minecraft result has "downloadType": "page" with "downloadNote": "Visit 9Minecraft page for download link"
Impact: Users must leave the app and navigate external sites - violates direct download requirement
Verification: Query "medieval castle" - all 9mc-* IDs have downloadType: "page", NOT "direct"

DEFECT #4: HIGH - 9Minecraft Results Have Empty/Missing Thumbnails
------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirement: "Thumbnails must load from original source" / "Each result must have working thumbnail images"
Evidence: "Underwater City – Lumina Nocturnale Map" has empty thumbnail: "thumbnail": ""
Impact: Broken UI experience, missing visual assets
Verification: Query "underwater city" - result ID 9mc-1770145579755-1 has empty thumbnail

DEFECT #5: MEDIUM - Modrinth Scraper Not Returning Results
----------------------------------------------------------
Requirement: Multi-source aggregation / scrapersLoaded: true in health check
Evidence: Health check shows modrinth scraper "enabled": true, "accessible": true, but NEVER appears in search sources
Impact: Modrinth results completely absent despite being "enabled"
Verification: Multiple searches ("mansion", "castle", "horror") only show curseforge + nineminecraft sources

DEFECT #6: MEDIUM - Invalid Download ID Returns 302 Redirect Instead of Error
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirement: Proper error handling for invalid resources
Evidence: curl /api/download?id=INVALID returns "Found. Redirecting to https://modrinth.com/project/INVALID/versions" with HTTP 302
Impact: Poor error handling, unexpected external redirects, confusing user experience
Expected: HTTP 400/404 with JSON error message
