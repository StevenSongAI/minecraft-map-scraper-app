RED TEAM ASSESSMENT - LIVE DEPLOYMENT TEST
Live URL: https://web-production-9af19.up.railway.app
Test Time: 2026-02-04T00:31:16Z

====== CRITICAL DEFECTS FOUND ======

DEFECT #1: DEMO MODE ACTIVE (CRITICAL FAILURE)
Evidence: Health check returns "apiConfigured": false, "demoMode": true
Requirement: "Demo/mock mode is FAILURE - app must use live CurseForge API"
Requirement: "Health check must return apiConfigured: true"
Impact: Application is not using real CurseForge API at all

DEFECT #2: MOCK DATA IDS (CRITICAL FAILURE)
Evidence: Search results return mock IDs (1001, 1002, 1003, 1011, etc.)
Requirement: "Results must have actual CurseForge IDs (not mock IDs like 1001, 1002)"
Test Query: "futuristic city with railways" returned IDs 1001, 1002, 1003
Impact: No real map data is being returned to users

DEFECT #3: PLACEHOLDER IMAGES (CRITICAL FAILURE)
Evidence: All thumbnails use "via.placeholder.com" URLs
Requirement: "Each result must have working thumbnail images (not placeholders)"
Example: "https://via.placeholder.com/280x160?text=Neo+Tokyo+2150"
Impact: Users see placeholder images instead of actual map screenshots

DEFECT #4: MULTI-SOURCE SCRAPING COMPLETELY BROKEN (CRITICAL FAILURE)
Evidence: ALL non-CurseForge sources return 0 results consistently
- modrinth: 0 results, "No results returned"
- planetminecraft: 0 results, "No results returned"  
- mcmaps: 0 results, "No results returned"
- minecraftmaps: 0 results, "No results returned"
Requirement: "Multi-source aggregation returns 2x+ more results than CurseForge alone"
Requirement: "95%+ of scraped download links must be valid and working"
Test Queries: "futuristic city with railways", "hell", "underwater city" - ALL showed 0 results from scrapers
Impact: Multi-source feature is completely non-functional

DEFECT #5: DOWNLOADS COMPLETELY BROKEN (CRITICAL FAILURE)
Evidence: Download endpoint returns HTTP 500 error with "API error: 403"
Test URL: https://web-production-9af19.up.railway.app/api/download/1001
Response: {"error":"DOWNLOAD_ERROR","message":"Failed to get download URL","details":"API error: 403"}
Requirement: "Download buttons must return valid ZIP files"
Requirement: "HTTP 200 responses, not 403 errors or JSON error messages"
Impact: Users cannot download any maps at all

====== SUMMARY ======

Deployment State: COMPLETELY NON-FUNCTIONAL
- CurseForge API: Not configured (demo mode)
- Search: Returns mock data only
- Downloads: Completely broken (500 errors)
- Multi-source scraping: 0% functional
