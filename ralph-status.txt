FIXES APPLIED
==================================================

✅ DEFECT #2: Download Button Fixed
   File: dashboard/app.js
   Changes:
   - Replaced broken download logic with direct blob download
   - Added proper error handling and user feedback
   - Downloads now work with /api/download?id= endpoint
   - Progress indicators: ⏳ Downloading... → ✅ Downloaded / ❌ Failed
   
   Testing: curl -I "http://localhost:3000/api/download?id=1001"
   Result: HTTP 200, Content-Type: application/zip ✓

✅ DEFECT #4: Query Validation Added
   Files: 
   - scraper/config.js (new) - Blacklist terms
   - scraper/server.js - Validation logic
   
   Blacklist Terms: texture pack, resource pack, mod, modpack, 
                    shader, optifine, forge, fabric, plugin, datapack
   
   Testing: curl "http://localhost:3000/api/search?q=OptiFine+texture+pack"
   Result: {"error":"INVALID_QUERY_TYPE", "count":0, "message":"..."} ✓
   
   Valid queries still work: "futuristic city" → 4 results ✓

==================================================

❌ DEFECT #3: Planet Minecraft Degraded
   Reason: Railway sandbox doesn't support Puppeteer with full Chrome
