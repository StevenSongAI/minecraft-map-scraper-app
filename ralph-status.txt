5 CRITICAL DEFECTS IDENTIFIED:

1. Multi-source scrapers COMPLETELY BROKEN (3/4 sources failing)
   - Planet Minecraft: Playwright Chromium not installed
   - MinecraftMaps: Timeout/403
   - 9Minecraft: Timeout

2. Search accuracy FAILS for compound queries
   - "Underwater city" returns 90% false positives (regular cities)
   - Violates <5% false positive requirement

3. Download endpoint (query param) returns 404
   - /api/download?id=X broken
   - /api/download/:modId works (inconsistent API)

4. Unified search response time marginal (6.3s)
   - Only passes because 3 sources are broken
   - Would exceed 10s with all sources

5. Health check misrepresents scraper status
   - Shows 9Minecraft as "accessible" but it times out in search

See progress.md for detailed evidence and timestamps.
