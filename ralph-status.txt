**Live URL:** https://web-production-631b7.up.railway.app
**Tested:** 2026-02-03

---

### DEFECT 1: CRITICAL - Planet Minecraft Completely Blocked
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Requirement Violated:** Multi-Source Web Scraping - "Primary additional sources: Planet Minecraft (largest repository after CurseForge)"

**Evidence:**
- Health check: `"accessible": false`, `"statusCode": 403`, `"canSearch": false`
- Error: "HTTP 403 Forbidden - Cloudflare bot protection active"
- All searches return: `"planetminecraft": {"count": 0, "success": false}`

**Impact:** Primary multi-source requirement is NOT functional. The app claims "multiSourceEnabled": true but cannot access the most important secondary source.

---

### DEFECT 2: HIGH - No Direct Download Links for 9Minecraft Results
**Severity:** HIGH
**Requirement Violated:** "Download buttons must return valid ZIP files"

**Evidence:**
- All 9Minecraft results have: `"downloadType": "page"`, `"downloadNote": "Visit 9Minecraft page for download link"`
- Example: `"downloadUrl": "https://www.9minecraft.net/atlantis-mod/"` (links to page, not file)
- No direct ZIP download available

**Impact:** Users cannot directly download from 9Minecraft results - they must navigate away to external sites.

---

### DEFECT 3: HIGH - No Direct Download Links for Modrinth Results
**Severity:** HIGH
**Requirement Violated:** "Download buttons must return valid ZIP files"

**Evidence:**
- All Modrinth results have: `"downloadType": "page"`, `"downloadNote": "Visit Modrinth page to download"`
- Example: `"downloadUrl": "https://modrinth.com/project/atlantis-firebeneathwater/versions"`

**Impact:** Users cannot directly download from Modrinth results - they must navigate away to external sites.

---

### DEFECT 4: MEDIUM - Search Returns MODS Instead of MAPS
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Requirement Violated:** "Search must return results that semantically match the user's query intent"

**Evidence:**
- Query "underwater city" returns: "Atlantis Mod (1.21.1, 1.20.1) – Underwater City, Artifacts" (a MOD, not a MAP)
- Query "medieval castle" returns: "Epic Structures Witch Huts Mod" (a MOD, not a MAP)
- Query "hell" returns: "Hell's Survivor" categorized as "Horror" mod

**Impact:** False positives - users searching for MAPS get MODS in results, causing confusion.

---

### DEFECT 5: MEDIUM - Missing Thumbnails for Scraped Results
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Requirement Violated:** "Each result must have working thumbnail images (not placeholders)"

**Evidence:**
- 9Minecraft result: `"thumbnail": ""` (empty string)
- Example: "Underwater City – Lumina Nocturnale Map" has no thumbnail

**Impact:** UI shows broken/empty thumbnails for scraped content, poor user experience.

---

## Summary
- **Total Defects Found:** 5
- **Critical:** 1 (Planet Minecraft blocked)
- **High:** 2 (No direct downloads for 2/3 secondary sources)
- **Medium:** 2 (Wrong content type, missing thumbnails)

The app CLAIMS multi-source support but:
1. Planet Minecraft (primary source) is completely non-functional
2. 9Minecraft and Modrinth provide NO direct downloads
3. Search returns wrong content types (mods instead of maps)

Only CurseForge works correctly.
