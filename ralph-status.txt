STATUS: BLOCKED

DATE: 2026-02-03

FIX COMPLETED:
✅ Copied scraper modules from /Users/stevenai/clawd/scraper/scrapers/ to projects/minecraft-map-scraper/scraper/scrapers/
✅ Updated import path in server.js from '../../scraper/scrapers' to './scraper/scrapers'
✅ Committed changes (commit d952d36)
✅ Pushed to GitHub (origin/main)

RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT BLOCKED:
❌ Railway not auto-deploying from GitHub pushes
❌ RAILWAY_TOKEN in project is invalid/expired
❌ Railway CLI requires interactive login (not available in agent context)
❌ Cannot access Railway dashboard to generate new token

VERIFICATION ATTEMPTS:
1. First push (commit 4ceaec1) - Railway did not auto-deploy
2. Second push with timestamp change (commit 2dba8a8) - Railway did not auto-deploy
3. Third push with Dockerfile update (commit d952d36) - Railway did not auto-deploy

LIVE URL STILL SHOWS OLD CODE:
- Health endpoint confirms: "Cannot find module '../../scraper/scrapers'"
- This proves Railway has NOT deployed the new commits

UNBLOCKING STEPS REQUIRED:
1. Visit https://railway.com/dashboard
2. Go to project Settings → Tokens
3. Generate new RAILWAY_TOKEN
4. Update GitHub Secret or run: railway up (with new token)
5. OR manually trigger deploy from Railway dashboard

CODE IS READY - DEPLOYMENT PIPELINE BLOCKED BY AUTH
