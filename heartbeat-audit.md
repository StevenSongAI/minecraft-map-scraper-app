# Heartbeat Audit Log

This file contains Red Team audits of the manager's heartbeat protocol compliance.
Each audit verifies the manager followed all 9 steps with evidence.

## Audit Format

Each entry documents violations found in a heartbeat:
- Violation type (which step was skipped/faked)
- Manager's claim vs reality
- Evidence from session history
- Severity rating

## Manager Accountability

3+ violations found → Manager must acknowledge and correct
<3 violations found → Auditor failed (must try harder next time)
