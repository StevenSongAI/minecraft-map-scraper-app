# RAILWAY ACCOUNT CLARIFICATION

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: TWO RAILWAY ACCOUNTS EXIST - USE THE RIGHT ONE

### ❌ AI's Railway Account (DELETE THIS)
- **Email:** stevenyjsongai@gmail.com
- **Owner:** Nox (AI) - "Nox — Steven Song's AI's Projects"
- **Status:** TRIAL
- **Project:** zesty-charm (a18c5404-6b6a-4d09-936f-e90d391a5a2d)
- **Live URL:** https://web-production-631b7.up.railway.app
- **CurseForge API Key:** Set here (WRONG ACCOUNT)
- **ACTION REQUIRED:** Delete or archive this account to avoid confusion

### ✅ Steven's Railway Account (USE THIS)
- **Owner:** Steven (human)
- **Status:** PAID (Hobby plan - upgraded)
- **API Token:** a9c5dd4a-b333-400e-bc99-c24f0cc91c3d
- **Current Status:** NOT successfully deployed yet
- **CurseForge API Key:** NOT set yet (needs to be added)
- **ACTION REQUIRED:** 
  1. Deploy minecraft-map-scraper to this account
  2. Set CURSEFORGE_API_KEY=$2a$10$Nq62KqieW9UZE94ViLrroOCiMA6jLberrv.6X1pz4iBGOjMM91L5y
  3. Verify deployment works

## Current Problem

The AI has been logged into the WRONG Railway account (stevenyjsongai@gmail.com) and directing subagents to work on that account instead of Steven's account.

## Solution

1. **Stop using AI's Railway account** - close browser sessions
2. **Delete AI's Railway account** - go to settings and delete
3. **Use ONLY Steven's Railway API token** - a9c5dd4a-b333-400e-bc99-c24f0cc91c3d
4. **Deploy to Steven's account properly**
5. **Set CurseForge API key on Steven's account**

## For Subagents

**ALWAYS use Steven's Railway API token:**
```
RAILWAY_TOKEN=a9c5dd4a-b333-400e-bc99-c24f0cc91c3d
```

**Never use:**
- stevenyjsongai@gmail.com Railway account
- Project ID a18c5404-6b6a-4d09-936f-e90d391a5a2d
- https://web-production-631b7.up.railway.app

Those belong to the AI's account which is being deleted.
