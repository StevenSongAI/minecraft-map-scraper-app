Changes include: (1) Added strict conflicting terms for underwater/atlantis/ocean vs futuristic/modern/city, (2) Separated 'town' from 'city' keyword mapping to reduce false expansions. GitHub Actions deployment reported success but production API may still be caching old code. Health check confirms apiConfigured: true, demoMode: false. Search returns real CurseForge data."
